Swarn is way to create cluster from multiple docker containters on differen machines.
We had to types of nodes: manager and worker.
Manager node can run containers.

First. we need enable to first manager node 
`$ docker swarm init` - for swich on manager mode

`$ docker service ls` - for get list of running servers

For add node to swarn claster
`$ docker swarm join-token` - get token from manager for access
`$ docker swarm join --<token> --listen-addr <ip:port>` - execute on worker machine with token wicth was generated on manager and ip:port of manager


`$ docker node ls` - get list node in swarm cluster !!ONLY ON SERVICE NODE!!
`$ docker service ls` - get service node list
`$ docker service ps <service name>` - get containers in the service


`$ docker service rm <service name>` - remove service
`$ docker node rm <node name>` - remove node from swarm cluster

`$ docker node promote <node name>` - promote node from worker to manager
`$ docker node demote <node name>` - demote node from manager to worker
